  <p>This project is a <b>Flutter-based fitness and step-counting app</b> developed as part of a team, with the Android module handled by other team members. My main contribution was the <b>Flutter front-end</b>, focusing on real-time step tracking and user engagement features.</p>

  <p>The app allows users to earn digital coins by walking, with rewards based on daily step goals. Challenges are set up to motivate consistent activity, and each 24-hour period is tracked individually — if the user does not meet the daily goal, steps are not counted toward rewards.</p>

  <p>Key functionalities include:</p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 12px; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">

    <li><b>Coin-based reward mechanism</b> for each goal achieved.</li>
    <li><b>24-hour reset</b> to ensure daily progress is tracked accurately.</li>
    <li><b>Team collaboration</b> where Android module and backend were handled by teammates.</li>
